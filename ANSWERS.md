- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

class components are reuseable in a way in which functional components are not. you are able to write components that use state more easily though it is not a dry as functional. 

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
mounting occurs when the component is initially called and renders the component outright. 
updating occurs when something about the component changes, say a user fills out a form and submits, updating occurs and the component is re-rendered according to whatever is set in the codebase. 
unmounting occurs when the user navigates away from the component and it is no longer needed. 

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
custom hooks allow users to create reusable code that can be used throughout the codebase for several purposes. 

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
it's important to test apps because in doing so you are making sure bugs get sorted out before things go live.
